* Type Ahead Search

Type Ahead Search is a feature that helps a user search when browsing on the Web. For example when searching on www.google.com, as one starts typing in search keywords, Google provides the user with suggestions. This challenge is a similar but very simplified version of what Google or Quora run in their backend. This service is completely in memory.

### Algorithm

On a very high level the search is based on implementing a trie data structure with some optimizations to it. It stores all data in the trie and then searches are optimized using the trie. Further optimizations are done by using other data structures like Maps and Sets. For a complete understanding the code would speak the best.
